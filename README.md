# Why is the Beta better than the alpha, and why got the program a new name?

**1)** The application is now completely rewritten in Python3 and it has a standalone GUI using wxPython Phoenix. It's got a lots of new features and useful tools included.

**2)** The name change is because it's now more than an extra big Bash script. Now, it's an independent program with more and more features coming. It's now something like a "tool center" or a "Swiss-army". **NOTE:** The name is HSuite, **not** HiSuite (which is the property of Huaweiâ„¢).

# Demo

# Why is the Beta better than the alpha, and why got the program a new name?

**1)** The application is now completely rewritten in Python3 and it has a standalone GUI using wxPython Phoenix. It's got a lots of new features and useful tools included.

**2)** The name change is because it's now more than an extra big Bash script. Now, it's an independent program with more and more features coming. It's now something like a "tool center" or a "Swiss-army". **NOTE:** The name is HSuite, **not** HiSuite (which is the property of Huaweiâ„¢).

# Demo

Here's a small demo of the beta. Lots of work in progress...

# What is HSuite?

*Be SSU (Simple, Small, Useful)*

HSuite (previously Helen) is a small program written in Python. Its main goal is to be the Linux "Swiss-army". It's simple and helpful for the new users who want to experience Linux as a daily OS, or for those who are switching distros often. ATTENTION! This program is currently in Beta stage (v0.3). **NOTE:** The first beta will be avilable soon. 
Currently works on Debian/Ubuntu and Arch based distros.
